Hello, I’m Milena. I’m an engineer in energy and I’m a cyclist in the city and on long trips. One of my projects is named [Vélo M²](https://ciklic.wordpress.com/) and it is a cycle-in cinéma where the spectators pedal to make the movie roll. I’m also at home in the fablab environment and I have animated many workshops with kids.
